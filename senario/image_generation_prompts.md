# AI Image Generation Prompts

This document contains prompts for generating all images needed for the school scenario, including the map tilemap and all agent portraits and sprites.

## 1. School Map Tilemap Generation Prompt

### Prompt for School Scene Tilemap

```
Create a **complete top-down 2D school campus scene** in **pixel art style**, rendered as a **single cohesive image** rather than separate scenes.
The style should follow **RPG pixel-art aesthetics** with a **32×32 tile-like look**, but the output is a **finished image**, not tiled JSON.

### **Scene Content**

The image should depict a full school campus from a top-down perspective, including:

#### **Buildings (with visible roofs and structural outlines)**

* A large **teaching building** with clear block segmentation suggesting classrooms, offices, and corridors
* A **library** with identifiable reading-room and study-room window patterns
* A **gymnasium** indicating areas for basketball and fitness rooms
* A **cafeteria** with dining-hall style exterior
* A **student dormitory** with repeated window layout
* An **administrative building** with principal/counseling office hints
* A **music classroom** and **art classroom** (small buildings or attached rooms)
* A **school gate** with a **security guard room**

### **Outdoor Areas**

* A **sports field** including a running track and football field
* **Continuous campus pathways** that naturally connect all major buildings
* **Detailed road elements**, such as:

  * Crosswalks
  * Curbs
  * Asphalt texture
  * Drainage grates
  * Road markings
  * Smooth intersections
* **Green spaces**, trees, bushes, benches, fountains, or campus decorations

### **Style Requirements**

* **Pixel art style**, 2D top-down
* Colors: **Warm, educational palette** (browns, beiges, greens, blues)
* Indoor vs outdoor areas implied through building roofs, shading, and layout
* Rich environmental details, avoiding empty or repetitive spaces
* No splitting the image: **produce one large, unified campus scene**

### **Output Requirements**

* **Generate a complete scene image**, jpeg format
* The scene should feel natural and connected, **not like multiple images stitched together**
* Ensure all pathways and roads logically link buildings and outdoor areas
